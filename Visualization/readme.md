# Ford GoBike System
## by Omar Ehab

## Dataset

>This document explores the Ford GoBike's trip data for public containing approximately 152446 bike rides from AUG2020. The attributes included the trip start/end time, as well as additional measurements such as user type.


## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, I found that there are two types of clients using the system: subscribers who are mainly daily commuters, having short trips to and from work, who rent a bike on weekdays at 8-9am and 5-6pm, and, occasionally around the lunch time, and customers, usually tourists or occassional riders who use the system mainly on weekends to explore the Bay Area.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I focus on customer habits. Since the Ford GoBike System currently offers 2 subscribtion types: Single Ride and Monthly Membership, I start by introducing the split between those who use the system occasionally and those who has a membership. Afterwards, I move to daily and weekly habits of customers. I use the heatmap to show when bikes are high in demand throughout the week. To finish, I introduce the histogram of the trip duration per customer type to further show the differences in renting behaviour.
